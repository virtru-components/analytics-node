#analytics-node

A node.js client for [Segment](https://segment.com) â€” The hassle-free way to integrate analytics into any application.

This fork supports usage with browserify using something like the following command:
```
$ browserify lib/** -o analytics-node.js -s analytics-node -r ./lib/index.js:analytics-node-req
```

Building this library using browserify allows for importing this library into other build systems such as Component.  Our
primary use-case for the ability to do this is we're then able to emit analytics in the background script for both Chrome
and Firefox without having to rely on Analytics.js side-loading scripts into the DOM and violating the Content Security
Policy (CSP) of the site we're integrating with.

This fork removes references to `superagent-proxy` and `debug` to reduce the size of the built library.

Also, there's a check for a predefined global variable named `componentRequest` specifically so that an object
matching the `superagent` API can be injected for use instead of `superagent`.  The purpose here is to allow us
to configure a `superagent` object that is provided with the FF xhr object.
